## Instructions for the second batch of code reviews

1. Fork this repository if you're doing this for the first time or pull in upstream changes if you already have a fork. [Read more about forking on github help pages](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo).
2. First, fix all tests that are broken (red). Focus on writing a minimum amount of code to pass the tests (green). The less code you write, the better.
3. Record your work in a single commit.
4. Second, write at least one new test case, or modify at least one existing test case. Focus on the new functionality. Make sure the new test is consistent with the already existing suite. New tests should not pass (be red).
5. Record your work in a second commit.
6. Push the changes to your fork repo.
7. Create a pull request.
